Introduction:
	Opencv python is a library that packages many commonly used, powerful algorithms into easy to use python modules. There is a lot of
	documentation online at http://docs.opencv.org/.

Installation:
	In your terminal call: sudo apt-get install python-opencv python-numpy
	
Sample Program:
	I have included two simple sample programs. The first, sample1.py, reads in one image from your webcam and and shows it until you press
	enter. The second, sample2.py, reads in images and shows them until you press ESC (a video).

Opencv Object:
	I have made a simple python class that encapsulates all the basic function. To use:
		from basic_functions import *
		x = Basic_Functions()
		x.show_frame()
